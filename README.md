# DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY

It's call `ng-worst` for a reason - it's a library for incomplete, random, potentially useless components. The purpose of this library is as a way for people to practice contributing to an open source Angular library.

Of course... you can use it for fun if you want, just, you know, don't go building applications with it.
