# Contributing

Remember, this library has low standards and just about no matter what you contribute will be merged (as long as it isn't destructive or offensive). However, there are few rules to follow.

1. You can use the `playground` app to test out your contribution, but **don't** include changes you have made to the `playground` app in your pull request
2. You should follow the `worst-*` naming convention for your selectors, and also export your contributions in the form of `Worst*Module` (e.g. `WorstTableModule`, `WorstButtonModule`)
3. Use the existing folder structure for exporting components
4. You can make wackier changes if you want, add folders and so on. Do whatever you like for the experience, it might just mean your changes won't be merged (they might be though!)

To make a contribution, you will need to:

1. Make a fork of this repository
2. Clone your fork to your machine and make your changes
3. Send a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) back to this repository
